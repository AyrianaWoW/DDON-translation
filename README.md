## External Credits

Many of the translations are taken from or adapted from the excellent work of other teams or people:
* [Dragon's Dogma Online Translations](http://ddonline.tumblr.com/) and their wiki [The White Dragon Temple](http://ddon.wikidot.com/). Their wiki is a great reference for playing DDON!
* [Julien-schu](http://julien-schu.tumblr.com/). Julien-schu's blog is a great resource for keeping up to date with news on DDON.
* [Feld](https://github.com/Feldherren) for writing toml2csv.py, something my brain was much too small for.
The current progress of this translation patch would not be where it is today without them!
